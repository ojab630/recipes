Melt 45 ml of the ghee.

Place both kinds of flour in a large bowl and make a dip in the centre.

Pour the sea salt, 125 ml water and the melted ghee into the dip and knead well.

(15 - 30 ml water may be added if necessary.) The dough should remain soft.

Cover the dough and let rest for approx. 1 hour.

Divide the dough into 6-8 pieces.

Roll out each piece on a floured surface to a thin circle.

Place the circles next to each other.

Melt 30 ml ghee and rub it into the dough circles.

Melt a little ghee in a pan and bake the parathas for 2-3 minutes.
